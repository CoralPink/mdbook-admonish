# v2 Notes

## Compatibility to drop

- v1 config loading system from block info strings
- v2 config loading system from block info strings
- Support for `custom` configuration, moved to `directive.custom`
- `css-id-prefix` kebab case

## Wishlist

- `mdbook` not to use a broken version of `toml` in the public api
- `mdbook` to support loading css files from plugins
